./final [-emf] [file_input]

Absence of a file will result in the program asking for you to enter the components of the query,
which would otherwise be given to it from the file. Upon success, it will create the files
result.cpp and result.h These can then be compiled by entering 'make output', and then run 
as './result'

-emf This flag indicates to the program that it will be given an EMF query, without
	 this flag, it will treat it as either a normal query or a MF query

[file_input] The directory, absolute or relative, of the file input for the program


./generate [entries]
Will generate [entries] entries when run into the table defined in config.h. If not given any parameters,
it will generate a default of 3000 entries
