In order for this program to run, please make sure that you have all of the listed dependencies installed.
If you are using a debian based OS, which uses apt, you can do this easily via the commands
`sudo apt-get update`
`sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev mysql-client openssl cmake -y`

Once that is out of the way, set up the mysql connector by opening a terminal, 
and cd into the folder named mysqlconnector, then following the instructions at
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-cpp/en/connector-cpp-installation-source-unix.html

Once that is completed, the last part of the configuration which is needed is modifying the config.h header, 
replace the dummy information inside that header with the actual information, and configuration is complete!

cd into the main directory of this project, (it has the makefile in it), and then run `make` to compile it

You can optionally run `make generate` if you wish to use the program which randomly generates entries for the table
