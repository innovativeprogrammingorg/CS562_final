# Pick install location for the main library
# ------------------------------------------
#
# On Windows the install layout is as follows, where NN is the MSVC version
# used to build the connector:
#
#  {lib,lib64}/mysqlcppconnX-vsNN.dll              <-- shared library
#  {lib,lib64}/vsNN/mysqlcppconnX-static.lib       <-- static with /MD
#  {lib,lib64}/vsNN/mysqlcppconnX-static-mt.lib    <-- static with /MT
#  {lib,lib64}/vsNN/mysqlcppconnX.lib              <-- import library for DLL
#
# On Linux it is as follows, where A.B is the API version number
#
#  {lib,lib64}/libmysqlcppconnX.so.A.B             <-- shared library
#  {lib,lib64}/libmysqlcppconnX.so.A               <-- soname link
#  {lib,lib64}/libmysqlcppconnX.so                 <-- development link
#  {lib,lib64}/libmysqlcppconnX-static.a           <-- static library
#
# Additionally, if connector is built in debug mode, the libraries are installed
# in debug/ subfolder of {lib,lib64}/ or {lib,lib64}/vsNN/.
#
# Note: We expect VS variable to hold the "vsNN" bit on Windows.
